# Ice
Ice - named after [Glaze](https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/) - is a simple obfuscation utility 
that takes in utf-8-encoded files (such as text files that include starting and ending quotation marks)
and outputs bits of html laden with <span>s containing random bits of noisy text.

## Running the script
The syntax for running this script is as follows:

`python ice.py path/to/your_story.txt 1 234`

In this syntax, `python` is your Python command, `ice.py` the path from your terminal directory to your script, 
and `path/to/your_story.txt` the path from your terminal directory to your story (of course).  The next numbers,
referred to throughout the code as `m` and `p`, affect the noise applied.  The first parameter, `m`, determines
the intensity of the noise, with `1` being a sort of base-line amount of noise.  Increasing `m` will increase the
length of fake snippets and the frequency with which they occur.  The second parameter, `p`, is a permillage, that
is to say, the number of out of every thousand, of the noise snippets which will come from the first source (literal
random words) as opposed to the second source (the spam folder).

Running the above command will produce a file in the same directory as yours with the same name and the `.ice` extension.
It is also utf-8 encoded.

## Sources of noise
There are two types of noise used by this script:  random words, and existing texts.

Included in this folder is a file which allegedly contains the 10,000 most common words in the 
English language, borrowed from [a GitHub repo](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english)
which took them from Peter Norvig's compilation of n-grams from Google's Trillion Word Corpus.
The list is included here for the sake of making the script work, but it isn't hard to replace
(which is convenient, as it appears the trillion-word corpus is made up largely of spam emails
and stolen webpages).  As they are presented in descending order by frequency, and words tend
to be distributed according to [Zipf's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%E2%80%93Mandelbrot_law),
these words are sampled with that distribution to create the first source of noise.  The length
of these snippets is similarly randomized in a way involving the harmonic series.

The second source of noise is the spam folder.  Glaze focuses on protecting an artist's style
by attempting to trick learning models into mistaking it for another (especially abstract styles);
this allows for something similar.  The script will sample randomly from all the texts in the spam
folder, bringing in texts and bits of stories from styles that are presumably different from the
author.  In that folder in this repository are two texts from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/),
specifically _Robert's Rules of Order_ and _Little Women_, chosen from the list of recent
and popular documents respectively, for having had little influence on this writer's style.

## Using the output
Most of the <span>s in the output
have a class name of 'a', 'e', 'i', or 'o', though some use consonants; only those with a vowel as a 
class name contain noisy text.  When this html is placed online, and a css file containing:
```
.a {
  display: none;
}
.e {
  display: none;
}
.i {
  display: none;
}
.o {
  display: none;
}
```
is included, the text is perfectly readable for humans.

## Examples
The following examples are all based on the following paragraph, the first of a
[short story](https://nationalrecordingregistry.net/portfolio/stories) called 
"The Umbrella Man", which I wrote while interested in medium-length horror stories:

>It wasn’t too dark or stormy a night, the last night I really enjoyed rain, before “astraphobia” - the fear of thunder and lightning - seemed like a real thing, not a misspelling of the fear of stars.  As a little kid, I loved the rain, loved the soothing ambient sound, the smell of wet leaves and lawns, the beautiful grayish greenish blue behind droplet-streaked windows - even seeing it in a school window would cheer me up.  Even the night of my first date, when I stricken with the certain belief that Kaitlyn, the sweetest girl in the world (or at least the school district), deserved better than me, and that a relationship between two thirteen-year-olds was certain to end in break-up, I watched the rain pelt the windows of Starbird Diner and felt at ease, as the two beliefs canceled out.
